🔍 Description
The script loads the Iris dataset and applies several machine learning classification techniques to distinguish between three species of Iris flowers based on petal and sepal measurements.

✅ Features:
Data loading and preprocessing
Data visualization (optional with matplotlib/seaborn)
Train-test split
Implementation and evaluation of the following models:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
AdaBoost with Decision Tree

🛠 Libraries Used:
pandas, numpy
matplotlib, seaborn
scikit-learn (datasets, models, metrics)

📊 Output:
Each model is evaluated on test data and the accuracy score is printed to compare their performance.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/irish-flower-classification.git

Navigate into the project directory:
cd irish-flower-classification

Run the script:
python irish_flower_datasets.py
Note: Ensure all required libraries are installed using pip install -r requirements.txt if provided, or install them manually.

📚 Dataset Info
The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher. It contains 150 samples from three species of Iris — setosa, versicolor, and virginica — with 4 features each:
Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
